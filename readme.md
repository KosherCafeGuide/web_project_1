Recent updates:

*Restructured file system for CSS files according to BEM rules.
*Added this Readme file. 

This project demonstrates the use of advanced HTML and CSS code, including iframes, animations and Flexbox named and organised according to BEM rules. The content of the project relates to various methods of improving ones ability to learn quickly and effectively, and how to overcome procrastination!

While there are aspects of this project that can be improved, there are more exciting projects that will take up my time in the future, such as an adaptive landing page called From Hometown to Hometown.
